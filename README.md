# Learning Experience

- Implemented custom string manipulation functions: By creating my own string operations instead of relying on built-in functions, I gained a deeper understanding of how string manipulation works at a lower level.
- Enhanced code optimization: Writing functions from scratch allowed me to optimize them specifically for my translator's needs, improving code efficiency and reducing unnecessary overhead.
- Building a translator from English to 1007 required me to design algorithms for word replacements and transformations, enhancing my problem-solving and algorithmic thinking skills.
- Developed practical experience in natural language processing: Building a translator involved tasks such as tokenizing words and handling grammar, providing hands-on experience in natural language processing.
